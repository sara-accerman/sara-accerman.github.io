# Setup Laravel Homestead with Vagrant and Virtual Box on Windows

### Introduction

Recently I decided to install Laravel Homestead on Windows. It was my first experience with php and Larval was not fun, at least not for me. So this article was purly dedicated for up and running Laravel Homestead. First of all dont get panic, you will be up and running in no time.

### Installing Vagrant and Virtual box

Install lastest version of virutal box from here [Virtual Box] (https://www.virtualbox.org/). Do the same for the [Virtual Box] (https://www.vagrantup.com/). Dont worry if you have not worked upon the Vagrant, it works out side.

  Please make sure you uninstall any other Virtual Environment like vmplayer or anything else. Alone this will save some time.
